          <p>The following are furniture's operas realized by one of the most important Italian architects, Mario Bellini.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/428590/blob/master/final-project/material/images/MarioBellinifoto.jpg?raw=true" alt="1"></p>

<p>Mario Bellini (born February 1, 1935, Milan) is a world renowned Italian architect and designer. He graduated from the Milan Polytechnic - Faculty of Architecture in 1959 and began working as an architect himself in the early 1960s. He is the winner among others of 8 Compasso d’Oro and prestigious architecture awards including the Medaglia d’Oro conferred on him by the President of the Italian Republic.
Like many other Italian architects, his activities range from architecture and urban planning to product and furniture design.</p>

<p>Like many other Italian architects, his activities range from architecture and urban planning to
product and furniture design.
His early international success grew rapidly during the first two decades, especially in the
design sector, and reached its peak in 1987 with the greatest acknowledgement expressed in
a personal retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art of New York, which at the time
already included 25 of his works in its Permanent Collection, including a remarkable set of
Olivetti machines as well as the furniture for B&B and Cassina - such as the famous "Cab" chair
- and the innovative office chairs designed for Vitra.
His career as a product and furniture designer began in 1963.
From 1963 to 1991 he was chief design consultant for Olivetti.
For many years he designed furnishing products and systems for B&B Italia and Cassina, TV
sets for Brionvega, and hi-fi systems and electric organs for Yamaha.
For 5 years he worked as an automobile design consultant with Renault.
In 1972 he was commissioned to design and build the prototype of the Kar-a-Sutra mobile
environment for the exhibition “Italy: the New Domestic Landscape” at the Museum of Modern
Art in New York.
He has also designed for Fiat and Lancia, lamps for Artemide, Erco and Flos, and office
furniture for Vitra.
Other firms for whom he has designed and/or continues to design products include (in Italy)
Acerbis, Bras, Driade, Candy, Castilia, Flou, Marcatrè, Meritalia, Natuzzi and Poltrona Frau; (in
Belgium) Ideal Standard; (in Germany) Lamy and Rosenthal; (in Japan) Fuji and Zojtrushi; and
(in the USA) Heller.
MBA's headquarters of some 1,500 sq.m in Milan were designed by Mario Bellini himself in the
early 1990s, and today an average of 30 to 35 architects. </p>

<h1>The Project: Living Room</h1>
<img src="https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/428590/blob/master/final-project/material/images/SalottoMariobellini.jpg?raw=true" alt="3">
<p> In this website,i'll show you my works;my realization of many pieces of furniture designed by Mario Bellini, and unified in an unique Living Room.
All the Project has been realized with The PlasmJs and PyPlasm Frameworks, Projects of the <strong>Professor Alberto Paoluzzi</strong> from The <strong>University of Roma 3</strong>.
The Living room consists of these pieces of furniture:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sofa &quot;BiBambola&quot; RED </li>
  <li>Sofa &quot;BiBambola&quot; BLACK </li>
  <li>Armchair &quot;Bambola&quot;RED </li>
  <li>Armchair &quot;Bambola&quot;BLACK </li>
<li>Shelving &quot;Sudoku&quot;BLACK/WHITE </li>
<li>Table &quot;Yin e Yang&quot;BLACK/WHITE </li>
<li>Chandelier &quot;Nuvola&quot;WHITE </li>
</ul>

<h2>&quot;BiBambola&quot;</h2>
<p>Icons of the Seventies and Compasso d'Oro in 1979, Le Bambole will never become old-fashioned. What makes the sofas in the collection so special is their apparent lack of a bearing frame, their extremely natural shape, the blend of comfort, softness and elasticity conveyed by their look.Bibambola and La Bambola are masterfully rendered in their new upholstery:denim,aggressive rough tanned leather and the the new coloured cottons.</p>

<h2>&quot;Le Bambole&quot;</h2>
<p> “Le Bambole” an incredibly successful collection designed in the 1970s, winner of the “Compasso d’Oro” Award in 1979. What makes “Le Bambole” really special is the apparent absence of a supporting structure. The extremely natural look of the overall shape, and the message of comfort, softness and elasticity that its appearance conveys so effectively are the characteristics that make a lasting impression The idea comes from a shopping bag which contains amorf materials that setting down, takes that shape.
  From the same series : the "Bibambole" sofa.</p>

<h2>&quot;Sudoku &quot;</h2>
<p>Its name is Sudoku and it represents an enigma: it departs from every reassuring modular style and even from the physical manifestation of its image, instable and difficult to decipher. It is comprised of a blend of diverse horizontal and vertical elements. Some are dressed in a blazing uniform with strong light and dark contrasts, while others boast a perfectly reflective, silvery finish.

An unusual collection of surfaces with strong physicality, combined with the "absence" of mirrored sides and the infinite virtual illusions lent by the reflecting surfaces. Sudoku. A topological-perceptive enigma in which books and objects appear to multiply and increase.
The Sudoku bookcase comes in three styles: one in hand-applied silver leaf and Santo Brazilian rosewood, produced in a limited edition of 49 exemplars. The other standard versions include one with a white and black painted finish and the other in black and white plywood and a mirror-polished aluminum surface.

The unusual quality of the back, half as deep as the shelves, create an effective play on the parts and result in an array of possible compositions that become an original, harmonious and versatile unit.

 Sudoku is a puzzle of unequal elements that create a unique space when horizontally and vertically assembled. Its sides, easily coupled without overlap, allow for the creation of continuous walls by simply adding more modules. The reflective and striped surfaces play on the empty and full spaces to create a striking visual effect.

Materials and finishes
Mirror-polished aluminum and black and white plywood; matt black and white painted; silver leaf and Santos Brazilian rosewood.</p>

<h2>&quot;Yin e Yang&quot;</h2>
<p>Coffee table “YIN & YANG”, design Mario Bellini. The shape of these coffee tables takes its inspiration from the Taoist symbol expressing the fundamental principles of the polarity of universal energy. The split level top is available in the following finishes: hide (mocha, black and anthracite gray), gloss or opaque lacquer (black and white), transparent methacrylate. </p>

<h2>&quot;Nuvola&quot;</h2>
<P>Suspension lamp Nuvola is the design classic by Mario Bellini from 1974, reissued by Nemo Cassina Lighting. Made of opaline polycarbonate. From 1974, Mario Bellini is anticipating the recent trend of lights made with synthetic materials. Bellini's vision and creativity gives life to NUVOLA, a cloud-shaped pendant lamp of big dimensions, offering true light all around without being too intrusive.</P>
